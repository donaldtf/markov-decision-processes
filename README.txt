### Getting Started ###

In order to recreate the results shown in my report, please clone the following repo from github.

https://github.com/donaldtf/markov-decision-processes

Or you can just use this command to clone it via ssh: `git clone git@github.com:donaldtf/markov-decision-processes.git`

This repo contains all the code needed to reproduce my results, including the data sets that were used. The project structure looks like this:

/folder

### Install Dependencies ###

The code relies on the following dependencies in order to run. You can install them via your favorite method (conda, pip, etc.).

- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scipy
- seaborn

Once these are all installed you should be ready to run the code

### Running the code ###

Running the code is simple once you have your dependencies installed. Simply run the following command

`python run_all.py`

This will generate all of the plots shown in the report, plus other plots that were excluded from the report due to the constraint on report length.

Note: Running all of the algorithms at once may take 10 - 15 minutes, depending on your machine, to complete.
